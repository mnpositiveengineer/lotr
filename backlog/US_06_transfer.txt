WHO:
System
WHAT:
Should record current state of the user in the process like:
(1) if the user's started the questionary
(2) how many question has user already answered
(3) if the user has already ended the questionary and was provided with the result

1. If the user has not started the questionary yet and is not stored in database, every time she/he enters other page than starting page, the system will redirect her/him to starting page.
2. If the user has answered x question and next question to answer is x+1, every time she/he enters page with other question, the system will redirect her/him to the x+1 question.
3. If the user has already ended the questionary, every time she/he enters page with any question, the system will redirect her/him to the end page with the result.
To 
WHY
So that user cannot start answering questions without entering name and starting questionary.
So that user cannot answer each question more than once and is required to answer question in given order.
So that user  cannot answer questions after the result is provided, unless she/he delete the data fro database.
